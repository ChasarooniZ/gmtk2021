<h1>Roomba Fighter VII</h1>
This game was made for the [GMTK 2021 Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2021)
I made this game with a friend of mine in 48 hours using [Godot](https://godotengine.org), which is a game engine built on python.

The game was our first foray into making multipalyer games connect over the network and we learned a lot. 

The game is a battle royale type competition where your goal is to charge into the other Roombas, knocking them out to be come the last survivor. In addition when you take out another roomba it joins you and has some influnce over your movement. Can you handle the stack of Roomba's and emerge victorious find out in this game coming to an [Itch.io page](https://chasarooni.itch.io/roomba-fighter-vii)
